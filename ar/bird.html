	<h2>Baltimore Oriole</h2>
	<p>The Baltimore oriole are "probably one of the coolest" birds because of their blaze-orange bodies and black wings with white markings. They are a migrant bird that is found in Chicago only during the spring and summer. They're fairly easy to find when they are here, though. They will also visit jelly feeders. They also have a beautiful, flute-like song.</p>
	<p></p>

	<h2>Blue Jay</h2>
	<p>Of all the jays in North America, the blue jay is the one most commonly found around Chicago. Blue jays are intelligent birds, although they are sometimes accused of being bullies at people's bird feeders. "They're big, they're loud. They also have that big crest on their head. They're just a really fun bird to watch."</p>
	<p></p>

	<h2>Rock Pigeon</h2>
	<p>That's right: the pigeon. They get a bad rap, but Igleski says there is plenty that makes this bird beautiful. The rock pigeon is not originally native to North America, but it has still been around for hundreds of years, particularly in urban areas. In their natural habitat, they tended to nest on rocky cliffs, "so buildings are a great surrogate" for that. If you can set aside your preconceptions about pigeons, you'll notice what makes them cool: their red feet, red eyes, and the green and purple iridescence on the neck against their gray bodies. "They're also fun to watch, even when they're hanging around downtown. They'll get just close enough to you to maybe try to get some food and then fly away,"</p>
