	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_The_Republic">The Statue of The Republic</a> is a 24-foot-high gilded bronze sculpture in Jackson Park, Chicago, Illinois by Daniel Chester French. It is based on a colossal original statue, which was a centerpiece of the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. That statue was made of temporary materials and was destroyed after the fair. The smaller-scale replica sculpted by the same artist was erected in 1918 in commemoration of both the 25th anniversary of the Exposition and the Illinois' statehood centennial.</p>
