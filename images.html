<p> All of the content used in the project was made by me in photoshop. I used <a href="file:///C:/Documents/projects/College%20Stuff/Semester4/Immersive/ar/images.html">this site</a> for sourcing the images, and linked the sources for the facts on the pages where the information was. In the actual project file, any layer edit does not get applied for in the aero file, so it causes the in app photoshop file to be the wrong colors. </p>

<h2> Behavior Tree</h2>

 <div id="pngs">

	<figure><img src="img/behavior1.png" alt"behaviors"></figure>

	<figure><img src="img/behavior2.png" alt"behaviors"></figure>

</div> <!--close pngs -->

<p> I chose not to embedded the facts into the screen, as it worries me for people to be reading too much while walking and on their phones. I think linking to an external site where the text doesn't move is the safest. 
Along with that, I am very proud of the light bouncing animation that happens while the item is waiting to be pressed. </p>

<h2>Final Project</h2>	

 <div id="pngs">

	<figure><img src="img/anim.gif" alt"animation"></figure>
	
	<p> <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/Q1rRAbW2v7Q">THIS</a> is the link to the final video! I made the icons to tap intentionally high, so that people are not looking down while walking as that is one of the main worries when using AR projects, since it puts people in danger. After the recording of the video I have edited the height a bit to make it slightly shorter. </p>

	<p> while this project is meant to be played near the art insitute, I think it could work in several locations by just changing the last stop to something else. </p>
